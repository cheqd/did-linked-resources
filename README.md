This specification describes a standardized way of referencing, dereferencing and fetching digital resources (schemas, trust & status lists, visual representations of Verifiable Credentials, governance documents, logos). Additionally, this specification describes a way to associating digital resources with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and organize resources within DID-Linked Collections, where each individual resource is identifiable and retrievable through its own DID URL.
